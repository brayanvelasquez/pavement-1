# Pavement-1
The DNN predictions versus linear elastic modeling in Pitra Pave softwareÂ® were successfully compared using the R2 coefficient and the RSME. This outcome offers a tool for researchers and designers that can facilitate the processes of analysis and design of pavement structures when dealing with multiple design variables that configure multiple decision scenarios. In this context, pavement structural analysis programs require a higher computational cost and time from the analyst than the approach supported here by a DNN. Additional research is under development for predicting the mechanical response of pavement structures simulations under more comprehensive material constitutive models.
